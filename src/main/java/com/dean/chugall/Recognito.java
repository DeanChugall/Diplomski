/**
 * Front class for accessing Recognito's speaker recognition features
 * <p>
 * {@code Recognito} holds a set of vocal prints associated with user keys and allows 
 * execution of different tasks on them :
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a vocal print from an audio sample and store it with an associated user key</li>
 * <li>Merge a new vocal sample into an existing vocal print</li>
 * <li>Speaker recognition : analyse vocal characteristics from an unknown sample and return user keys 
 * whose vocal print are closest matches</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Recognito expects all vocal samples to be comprised of a single channel (i.e. mono). Using a stereo sample 
 * whose channels are identical will merely double processing time. Using a real stereo sample will make 
 * the processing less accurate while doubling processing time.<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code Recognito} is generified in order to allow the user to specify its own type of user keys.
 * The constraints on user keys are the same as those for {@code java.util.Map} a key<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is up to the client to manage persistence of the created vocal print objects. Persisted vocal prints
 * may be passed into an alternate constructor as a Map of user keys pointing to a vocal print.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For methods taking a file handle :<br/>
 * Supporting each and every file formats is a real pain and not the primary goal of Recognito. As such,
 * the conversion capabilities of the javax.sound.sampled are used internally.
 * Depending on your particular JVM implementation, some file types may or may not be supported.
 * If you're looking for MP3 or Ogg support, check Javazoom SPI's.
 * In case you may choose, Recognito's preferred file format is PCM 16bit mono 22050 Hz (WAV files are PCM)<br/>
 * You may also want to check http://sox.sourceforge.net for dedicated conversion software.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Threading : usage of Recognito is thread safe, see methods documentation for details
 * </p>
 * @author Dean Chugall
 * @see {@link java.util.Map} for the constraints on Key objects
